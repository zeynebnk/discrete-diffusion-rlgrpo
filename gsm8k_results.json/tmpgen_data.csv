\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]

So, Anna spent $10 on the books.

Since Anna bought 2 books and both books cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books by 2:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cookies:
Each cookie costs $0.10.
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays:
Carl pays with a $10 bill, so he gives $10.00.
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.00.

\[ \boxed{4} \]","To determine how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.

12,"First, determine Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at 3 miles per hour and this is half as fast as her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.

Next, determine her walking speed. Since she can run 4 times faster than she can walk, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, calculate the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she spends (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours running and (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours walking.

Calculate the distance she covers while running:
Distance running = Speed running * Time running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles

Calculate the distance she covers while walking:
Distance walking = Speed walking * Time walking = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles

Finally, find the total distance traveled in six hours:
Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

#### 18","If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
If she spends one-third of the time running, she runs for 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours.

In 2 hours, she can run 6 * 2 = 12 miles.
In 4 hours, she can walk 3 * 4 = 12 miles.
Therefore, Dana can travel a total of 12 + 12 = 24 miles in six hours.

If she can run at a rate of 6 miles per hour, then her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
To find the distance she can travel in six hours, we need to calculate the distance she covers while running and walking separately and then add them together.
The distance she covers while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
The distance she covers while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.
The total distance she can travel in six hours is 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \]

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ 9.00 + 5.00 = 14.00 \]

Next, we multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets (5):
\[ 14.00 \times 5 = 70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

The final answer is:
\[ 70 \]","To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by 5.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias at $3.00 each.
- Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each.

The cost for the petunias is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]

2. For the next 1 week:
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so in 1 week, she plays \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \) days.
   - Therefore, she plays \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) hours.

Adding these together, Kris has played a total of \( 7 + 14 = 21 \) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. She has already played 21 hours, so she still needs to play:

3. He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

First, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
- Sleeping: 10 hours
- Working: 8 hours
- Walking his dog: 1 hour

Total time spent on activities:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Now, subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day to find the free time:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day.

37,"To find the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements, we need to determine his typing speed after the second increase and then calculate the average of the three measurements.

1. **Initial Typing Speed:**
   Jared starts with 47 WPM.

2. **First Increase:**
   He increases his typing speed to 52 WPM.

3. **Second Increase:**
   He increases his typing speed by 5 WPM.
   \[
   52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM}
   \]

Now, we have the three typing speed measurements:
- 47 WPM
- 52 WPM
- 57 WPM

To find the average, we sum these measurements and then divide by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \text{ WPM}
\]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ t + (t + 7) + t + (t + 7) = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4t + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4t = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ t = 7.5 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 7.5 years. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:

\[ t + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old.

The answer is: 14.5","Let's denote the age of one of the triplets as \( T \).

According to the problem, one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so the age of one twin is \( T + 7 \).

\[ T = 10 \]

So, one of the triplets is 10 years old. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of one twin is:

\[ T + 7 = 10 + 7 = 17 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is \( 17 \) years old.","Let's denote the age of one twin as \( T \) and the age of one triplet as \( Tr \).

\[ T + Tr = 44 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( T \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 2Tr + 7 = 44 \]

Next, we solve for \( Tr \):
\[ 2Tr = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 2Tr = 37 \]
\[ Tr = 17 \]

Now that we know the age of one triplet, we can find the age of one twin using the first equation:

   - He gathered two more than requested, so he gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

3. **Beakers:**
   - Igor was supposed to gather 7 beakers.
   - He lost some beakers, but the total number of items placed on the lab bench was 29.
   - The total number of items gathered is the sum of the test tubes, Petri dishes, and beakers: \( 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 \).
   - Since he placed 29 items on the lab bench, the number of beakers lost is \( 31 - 29 = 2 \).

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.

- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 80

Total number of students who passed = 340 + 40 + 80 = 460

Now, let's calculate the total number of students in the school.

- Third graders: 500
- Fourth graders: 100
- Fifth graders: 400

Total number of students = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Finally, the overall pass rate is 460 / 1000 = 0.46 or 46%.

98,"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the cost of lemons.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:
- They sell each glass for $0.50.
- They get 20 glasses per gallon.
- Total revenue = $0.50/glass * 20 glasses/gallon = $10/gallon.

Next, let's determine the total cost of making lemonade:
- The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.
- The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon.
- Total cost = $3/gallon + $2/gallon = $5/gallon.

Now, let's use the profit to find the cost of lemons:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
- They made $25 in profit.
- Total cost = Total revenue - Profit = $10/gallon - $5/gallon = $5/gallon.

So, the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon as calculated.","To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total revenue from selling the lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making the lemonade.
3. Calculate the total cost of lemons.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade:
- They sell each glass for $0.50.
- They get 20 glasses per gallon.
- Total revenue per gallon = $0.50 * 20 = $10.

Next, let's determine the total cost of making the lemonade:
- The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.
- The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon.
- Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lemons:
- Total cost per gallon = $5.
- They made $25 in profit.
- Total revenue - profit = $10 - $25 = $15.

Since the total cost per gallon is $5 and they made $25 in profit, the total cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.

#### 3","First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

They made $25 in profit, so the total revenue they made (which includes the cost of lemons and sugar) is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Profit} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Since the total revenue is $30 and the total cost is $5, we can verify the cost of lemons by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Cost of Lemons} = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, they spent $25 on lemons.

\[ \boxed{3} \]","First, let's determine the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon:

\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \]

Next, we know the total cost to make one gallon of lemonade includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2:

\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

They made $25 in profit, so the total revenue minus the total cost is equal to the profit:

\[ \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

This confirms our calculations are correct. Now, to find out how much they spent on lemons, we simply need to know the cost of lemons per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost of lemons per gallon} = 3 \]

Therefore, they spent $3 on lemons.

\[ \boxed{3} \]",0.0,0.3301078127721159,0.01879573947728343,0.0,0.0,"First, let's determine the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon:

Next, let's calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2:

\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Since they made $25 in profit, the total revenue from selling all gallons of lemonade must be $25 more than the total cost:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10 = 5 + 25 \]
\[ 10 = 30 \]

This equation is consistent, so we can now determine the total cost of lemons. Since the cost of lemons per gallon is $3, the total cost of lemons is:

Now, calculate the time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, she spends (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours running and (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours walking.

Calculate the distance she covers while running:
Distance running = Speed running * Time running = 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles

Calculate the distance she covers while walking:
Distance walking = Speed walking * Time walking = 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6, making 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number in one roll is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row is \( 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \).

Next, calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6, so there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes:

\[ \text{Probability} = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} \]

1. Calculate the initial amount of water in the tank.
2. Determine the total amount of water used in 6 days.
3. Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank.

1. The initial amount of water in the tank is half the amount of water in the pool:

- Difference = Final cost for Sheila - Final cost for Clara
- Difference = $548 - $398
- Difference = $150

#### 150","On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was 20 * $20 = $400. She received a $2 discount, so the final price she paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

The next day, the price per pomegranate increased to $30, so the total cost before the discount was 20 * $30 = $600. The store offered a 10% discount, so the discount amount was $600 * 0.10 = $60. The final price after the discount was $600 - $60 = $540.

\[ 25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce 10 liters of milk is:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

159,"Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Adding the new device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour will increase her daily consumption to 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

To find the difference in her weekly electric bill, we need to calculate the weekly cost before and after adding the new device.

Before adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
- Weekly consumption: 12 kilowatts/hour * 7 days/week = 84 kilowatt-hours

After adding the new device:
- Daily consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour
- Weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts/hour * 7 days/week = 98 kilowatt-hours

The difference in weekly consumption is 98 kilowatt-hours - 84 kilowatt-hours = 14 kilowatt-hours.

Since the cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, the difference in weekly electric bill is:
14 kilowatt-hours * $1.50/kilowatt-hour = $21
#### 21","First, calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before and after adding the new device:
- Before: 12 kilowatts per hour
- After: 12 kilowatts per hour + 2 kilowatts per hour = 14 kilowatts per hour

Next, calculate the daily cost for each scenario:
- Before: 12 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $18 per day
- After: 14 kilowatts per hour * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $21 per day

Now, calculate the weekly cost for each scenario:
- Before: $18 per day * 7 days per week = $126 per week
- After: $21 per day * 7 days per week = $147 per week

Finally, find the difference between the weekly electric bills:
- Difference = $147 per week - $126 per week = $21 per week

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21 per week.

#### $21 per week","First, calculate Ada's daily electric consumption before adding the new device:
- Original consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour

Next, calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device:

- New daily cost: 14 kilowatts * $1.50 per kilowatt-hour = $21 per day

Next, calculate the weekly cost for each consumption:
- Original weekly cost: $18 per day * 7 days = $126
- New weekly cost: $21 per day * 7 days = $147

Finally, find the difference between the two weekly costs:
- Difference = New weekly cost - Original weekly cost
- Difference = $147 - $126
- Difference = $21

1. **Initial Requirements:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Items Igor Gathered:**
   - Test tubes: Half as many as requested, so \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
   - Petri dishes: Two more than requested, so \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
   - Beakers: Correct number as requested, but lost some, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \).

3. **Total Items Placed:**
   - Total items placed on the lab bench: 29

1. **First 5 days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - Total rides in 5 days = 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - They ride twice the times they do on usual days.

   - Total rides in 2 days = 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

3. **Total rides in a week:**
   - Total rides = Rides in the first 5 days + Rides in the next 2 days

184,"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to determine the revenue from the brownies and the revenue from the cheesecakes, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.
- Revenue from brownies = Number of brownies * Price per brownie
- Revenue from brownies = 43 * $3 = $129

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
- Revenue from cheesecakes = Number of slices of cheesecake * Price per slice
- Revenue from cheesecakes = 23 * $4 = $92

Finally, let's sum the revenues from the brownies and the cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:
- Total amount raised = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
- Total amount raised = $129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221.

Answer: $221","To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately.

First, let's calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
Tommy sells 43 brownies, and each brownie is sold for $3.
\[ \text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake, and each slice is sold for $4.
\[ \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \]

Now, we add the revenue from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = 221 \]

So, Tommy raises $221.

#### 221","To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Revenue from brownies:**
   - Tommy sells 43 brownies.
   - Each brownie is sold for $3.
   - Total revenue from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129.

2. **Revenue from cheesecakes:**
   - Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
   - Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.
   - Total revenue from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $<<23*4=92>>92.

3. **Total revenue:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
   - Total revenue = $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221.

Therefore, Tommy raises $221 by selling 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the second bottle. The average temperature of the water in the bottle will be the average of the temperatures of the two sources.

The average temperature is given by:
\[

\[

- Third graders: 340 out of 500 = 0.68 * 500 = 340
- Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 = 0.40 * 100 = 40
- Fifth graders: 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth grades' pass rate, so they passed at 2 * 40/100 = 0.80 * 400 = 320

Next, find the total number of students who passed across all grades:

340 + 40 + 320 = 700

Now, calculate the total number of students across all grades:

500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Finally, find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students:

700 / 1000 = 0.70 = 70%

Answer: 70%","To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the pass rate for each grade and then find the average of those rates.

1. **Third Graders:**
   - 340 out of 500 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (340/500) * 100% = 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - 40 out of 100 students passed.
   - Pass rate = (40/100) * 100% = 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - The pass rate is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - Pass rate = 2 * 40% = 80%

Now, we calculate the average pass rate:
- Average pass rate = (68% + 40% + 80%) / 3
- Average pass rate = 188% / 3
- Average pass rate = 62.67%

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade.
2. Determine the total cost of making lemonade.
3. Use the profit to find the cost of lemons.

First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade:
- They sell each glass for $0.50.
- They get 20 glasses per gallon.
- Total revenue = $0.50/glass * 20 glasses/gallon = $10/gallon.

Next, let's determine the total cost of making lemonade:
- The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.
- The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon.
- Total cost = $3/gallon + $2/gallon = $5/gallon.

Now, let's use the profit to find the cost of lemons:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
- They made $25 in profit.
- Total cost = Total revenue - Profit = $10/gallon - $5/gallon = $5/gallon.

So, the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon as calculated.","To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total revenue from selling the lemonade.

- They sell each glass for $0.50.
- They get 20 glasses per gallon.
- Total revenue per gallon = $0.50 * 20 = $10.

Next, let's determine the total cost of making the lemonade:
- The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.
- The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon.
- Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lemons:
- Total cost per gallon = $5.
- They made $25 in profit.
- Total revenue - profit = $10 - $25 = $15.

Since the total cost per gallon is $5 and they made $25 in profit, the total cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.

#### 3","First, let's determine the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade. The cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

They made $25 in profit, so the total revenue they made (which includes the cost of lemons and sugar) is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Profit} = 5 + 25 = 30 \]

Since the total revenue is $30 and the total cost is $5, we can verify the cost of lemons by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Cost of Lemons} = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, they spent $25 on lemons.

\[ \boxed{3} \]","First, let's determine the total revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon:

\[ \text{Revenue per gallon} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \]

\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

They made $25 in profit, so the total revenue minus the total cost is equal to the profit:

\[ \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Profit} \]
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

This confirms our calculations are correct. Now, to find out how much they spent on lemons, we simply need to know the cost of lemons per gallon:
